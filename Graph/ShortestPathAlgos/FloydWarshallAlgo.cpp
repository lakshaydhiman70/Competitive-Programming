Key Idea
"Can I go from node A to node B via node K and get a shorter path than going directly?"

It keeps asking this question for every pair of nodes (i, j) and tries every possible intermediate node (k) to see if going through k makes it better.

So, for each node k, and for all pairs (i, j), it checks:

css
Copy
Edit
if dist[i][j] > dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]:
    then update dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]
