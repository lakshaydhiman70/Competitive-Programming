// What is the graph
//A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes that have data
//and are connected to other nodes through edges.

// o -- o
//          o
// o -- o

// here o is node we also call a node as vertices 
// and -- is edge

// Types of Graphs

// An undirected graph is a graph where edges are bidirectional, with no direction associated with them, i.e, there will be an undirected edge. In an undirected graph, the pair of vertices representing any edge is unordered. Thus, the pairs (u, v) and (v, u) represent the same edge.
// A directed graph is a graph where all the edges are directed from one vertex to another, i.e, there will be a directed edge. It contains an ordered pair of vertices. It implies each edge is represented by a directed pair <u, v>. Therefore, <u, v> and <v, u> represent two different edges.
