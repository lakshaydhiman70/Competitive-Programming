Great! Since youâ€™ve discarded all `.vs` changes, the next step is to ensure Git completely ignores the `.vs` folder going forward.  
Touch .gitignore
### **Final Steps to Ignore `.vs` Properly**
1. **Make sure `.vs/` is in your `.gitignore` file**  
   Open `.gitignore` and confirm it has this line:
   ```
   .vs/
   ```
   Save and close the file.

2. **Check if `.vs` is still tracked**  
   Run:
   ```sh
   git status
   ```
   - If `.vs` **does not appear**, Git is now ignoring it correctly âœ…  
   - If `.vs` **still appears**, follow the next step.

3. **Remove `.vs` from Git tracking (only if needed)**  
   If `git status` still shows `.vs` files, remove them from tracking:
   ```sh
   git rm -r --cached .vs
   ```
   Then, commit the changes:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Removed .vs from tracking"
   git push origin ATLS-2499  # Change branch name if needed
   ```

4. **Verify that `.vs` is ignored**  
   Run:
   ```sh
   git status
   ```
   If `.vs` is no longer listed, youâ€™re all set! ðŸŽ‰
